The Resume Parser is an intelligent application designed to automatically extract key candidate information—such as name, contact details, education, skills, experience, and job preferences—from uploaded resumes in PDF or DOCX formats. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Python-based automation, the system structures unstructured resume data into a clean format, enabling faster and more efficient candidate shortlisting.

Key Features:

📄 Upload and parse resumes in various formats

🧠 NLP-based information extraction (Name, Email, Mobile, Education, Skills, etc.)

🧩 Structured data output for seamless integration with HR tools

🔍 Candidate-job matching based on skillset and job role

💾 Export parsed data to CSV or database (MySQL)

👩‍💻 Built using Python, Tkinter GUI, and custom rule-based parsing logic

This project significantly reduces the manual effort required in screening resumes, and is ideal for use in HR management systems or recruitment platforms.
